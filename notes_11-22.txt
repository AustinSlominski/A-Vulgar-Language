So the problem seems to be coming from the fact that I am pushing my ecils'ed string through BEFORE numRot is being called.

So first, a word comes in that is 2 letters long:

first send word length (2)
receive, subtract 2 (0)
send lastRot bang
lastRot opens up endWord gate
endWord really is triggered last. LastRot is definitely referring to triggering the last automated, grapheme loop. 
SO IMMEDIATELY 2 LETTER WORDS HAVE TO TRIGGER LASTROT IMMEDIATELY (now corrected)
I have to assure the first letter has a match found (add watchpoint on the match... watch for "i")
So now things to be working in order, but the bang sent through to [s endWord] is being stopped (was the gate banged open?)
I'm not sending a bang to the onebang gate! I'm sending an int!

(after a word totally complete (including ecils), send bang through endWord gate. *Final*


So now I'm starting to think it has something to do with the fundamental order of things... I still don't want to have to move backwards unless I have to.

Another day and it's not finished. Learning still I guess.  Maybe I should really rethink the order of things in the patch. 

Should matches begin to be found immediately after receiving the word? (WELL THAT WAS THE ANSWER, got it)
